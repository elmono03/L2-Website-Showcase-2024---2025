<h3>GAMEPLAY CRITICISMS</h3>

<p>Before you can even play the game, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 requires 246 GBs of space to download; with this download, you are downloading Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Warzone, and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3. Upon initial download, users are not able to select what they want to specifically download, it is just labeled as Map Packs. Once the game has been downloaded, you can go into the game settings and choose to uninstall certain files based on the game (MW2, Warzone, MW3). When you look at MW3‘s file size, it is very tiny compared to all the other files downloaded (26 GBs).

In fact, many are deeming Modern Warfare 3 a Modern Warfare 2 DLC. This is partially due to the two games sharing the same file space but also the fact that most of MW3‘s assets are from Modern Warfare 2. On top of that, the maps within Modern Warfare 3 were promised for MW2 and were in the original game.

Yes, the maps look good, but the play style has become outdated. All of the weapons from Modern Warfare 2 AND Warzone carry over to Modern Warfare 3 giving players an unfair advantage against their counterparts; yes, there is a good variety of weapons in MW3, but why would or should a player use a weapon they aren’t comfortable with vs one they have practiced for countless hours. This is nice for those who want to use those weapons but there should be a separation of lobbies based on weapon availability.

The final two criticisms we will focus on are the mediocre campaign and all the bugs we have encountered since day one. A majority of the bugs are found in zombies but a few interesting ones were found in campaign and multiplayer. In multiplayer, there are a variety of ways to get out of the map using the deployable shield. Some of these bugs were around in the original Modern Warfare 2 maps and are still exploitable today.</p>

Genres: Third-person shooter, Action-adventure game Pacing feels a bit strange at first and does take some getting adjusted to, as well as the relatively quick time to kill (TTK). All of the same mounting mechanics return and a lot of fan favorite weapons like the M4, which to me is a staple. There are some new things sprinkled in and even new systems implemented to stop camping such as earning perks.

When you read “earning perks”, what it means is that you can still equip them to your loadouts, but through gameplay like capturing objectives or getting kills in Team Deathmatch, you can earn them for their actual use. This is in an attempt to control camping by putting players at a disadvantage that don’t play objectives or sit in one spot.

Other changes in Modern Warfare 2 include the killstreaks, which are typically only in Infinity Ward Call of Duty titles, but these can now be toggled to be scorestreaks for your preferred playstyle.

Weapons have the same customization that you’re used to in more recent releases, the biggest difference is the weapons themselves and how they feel and sound. However, there is one addition that I felt made this a bit more tactical.

While holding a main weapon, switching to your pistol sidearm shows a new animation that slightly moves your main weapon to make way for the pistol. It’s a small animation change but it does show that it’s not just a copy and pasted game from years past. Graphically, it’s fine but older consoles like the PS4 that I played on have started to show their age with the new improvements. Since it won’t hit the PC until after this goes live, I can give some leeway to what I saw during the play sessions. Be mindful that this beta is still unpolished so these can all change and fixed since there are some graphical glitches.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a 2019 first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. Serving as the sixteenth overall installment in the Call of Duty series, as well as a reboot of the Modern Warfare sub-series,[1][2][3] it was released on October 25, 2019, for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One.

The game takes place in a realistic and modern setting. The campaign follows a CIA officer and British SAS forces as they team up with rebels from the fictional Republic of Urzikstan, combating together against Russian Armed Forces who have invaded the country and the Urzik terrorist group Al-Qatala, while searching for a stolen shipment of chlorine gas. The game's Special Ops mode features cooperative play missions that follow on from the campaign. The multiplayer mode supports cross-platform multiplayer and cross-platform progression for the first time in the series. It has been reworked for gameplay to be more tactical and introduces new features, such as a Realism mode that removes the HUD as well as a form of the Ground War mode that now supports 64 players. A post-launch update introduces a free-to-play battle royale mode, Warzone, which was also marketed as a standalone title. Multiplayer also supports shared screen multiplayer. This mode includes bots, custom maps, custom game-modes and other creative game-interfering actions.

Infinity Ward began working on the game soon after the release of their 2016 title Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. They introduced an entirely new engine for the game, which allows for new performance enhancements such as more detailed environments and ray-tracing capabilities. For the campaign, they took influence from real-life conflicts, such as the Syrian Civil War, 2012 Benghazi attack, Raid of Osama Bin Laden's compound and terrorist incidents that have occurred in London. For the multiplayer, they scrapped the franchise's traditional season pass and removed loot boxes, enabling them to distribute free post-launch content to the playerbase in the form of "Seasons".[4]

Modern Warfare received praise for its gameplay, campaign, multiplayer, and graphics. Criticism focused on the handling of the campaign's subject matter, including the depiction of the Russian military, as well as balancing issues in the multiplayer. The game had sold over 30 million units by September 2020. A sequel, titled Modern Warfare II, was released in 2022.</p>

<p>Modern Warfare includes a battle royale game mode called Warzone, introduced during Season 2. The mode features 150 players, battling either in teams of four, three, two, or solo. Warzone is released as a free standalone game which can be downloaded independently.[16] The map combines several locations featured prominently in Multiplayer and Special Ops modes. Weapon balancing is maintained with parity to Multiplayer modes, with the exception of higher headshot damage to reward aiming. Similar to other battle royale games, Warzone features looting as a core aspect. Weapon customization is limited, as players can only pick up weapon variants with preset, unchangeable attachments.[17]

Looting is simplified compared to other battle royale games in general, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's Blackout mode in particular: instead of browsing via inventory, all loot items are situated across the map for players to view and pick up. Players can use armor plates to increase damage protection, and can carry up to five armor plates to swap out and repair at any given point. Upon being defeated, instead of dying permanently, players are taken to the "Gulag", a prison area where defeated players can compete in 1v1 scenarios and gain a second chance to return to the main map. Players can loot and stock up cash, which are used at buy stations to buy load out drops, killstreaks, equipment and revive tokens for downed teammates.</p>

 <P>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a 2024 first-person shooter video game co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software and published by Activision. It is the twenty-first installment of the Call of Duty series and is the seventh main entry in the Black Ops sub-series, following Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War (2020). Set during Operation Desert Storm, Black Ops 6's single-player story follows rogue CIA operatives Troy Marshall and Frank Woods as they assemble a team of agents to hunt down Pantheon, a paramilitary group with covert ties to the agency.

As with previous titles in the series, the game also includes a multiplayer component and the cooperative round-based Zombies mode; all three modes feature omnidirectional movement mechanics, allowing players to sprint, dive, and slide in any direction. Black Ops 6 boasts the longest development cycle in Call of Duty history, spanning four years. Marketing for the game began in May 2024, through the publishing of fictional advertisements on the front pages of multiple newspaper outlets and the release of several live-action teaser trailers; a full reveal debuted following the airing of the 2024 Xbox Games Showcase event on June 9. Black Ops 6 was released on October 25, 2024, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

Upon release, Black Ops 6 received generally favorable reviews from critics, achieved the largest launch weekend in the franchise's history, and was nominated for several accolades. All three modes were met with praise; critics positively highlighted the new omnidirectional movement system and the mission design of the game's single-player campaign.
